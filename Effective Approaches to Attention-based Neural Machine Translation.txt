* Attentional mechanism selectively focuses on parts of the source sentence during translation
* Neural machine translation == NMT
* Global approach always attends to all source words
* Local approach only looks at a subset of source words at a time
* Local achieves significant gain over the non-attentional approach
* NMT generalizes well to very long word sequence
